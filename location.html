      <h2 class="section__title">Budapest- A Middle European Gem</h2>
      <p>
        Last year, Budapest was voted the host for EuRuKo 2017. Budapest is the capital of Hungary, and also the largest city in the country. It's located right in the centre of Middle Europe, Carpathian Basin.
        <br>
        Budapest is cited as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, ranked as "the world's second best city" by Condé Nast Traveler and "Europe's 7th most idyllic place to live" by Forbes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city is bisected by the River Danube and several bridges connects the hilly Buda district with flat Pest. Suburban Buda and its historic castle district offer medieval streets and houses, museums, caves, Turkish baths and Roman ruins. The dynamic Pest side boasts the largest parliament building in Europe, riverside promenades, flea markets, bookstores, antique stores and café houses.
        <br>
        Enjoy the historical wonders during daytime then dive deep into the nightlife and discover various Ruin pubs, Roof deck pubs and clubs in the heart of the city.
